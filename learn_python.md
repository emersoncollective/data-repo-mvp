# So you are new to Python. 

Welcome! We would love to help you learn a new skill. Thankfully there are many resources online that can help get up to speed with Python quickly. 

We recommend going through the tutorials at [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Welcome). You should run through all exercises in **Learn the Basics**, and the **Pandas Basics** tutorial as well. This should take no more than a few hours of your time. If you would like to explore some additional resources these are also free and potentially useful.

Once you have completed this, you can come back here to resume your learning. You will find examples relevant to immigration space that you can run, or even modify and adapt to a different dataset!
