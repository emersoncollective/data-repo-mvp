# So you are new to Python. 

Welcome! We would love to help you learn a new skill. Thankfully there are many resources online that can help get up to speed with Python quickly. In particular, we recommend focusing your learning on Python 3.

We recommend going through the tutorials at [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Welcome). We like this resource because there is an integrated Python environment where you can practice writing and running code snippets. Our recommended crash course below should take only a few hours of your time.

You should run through all exercises in **Learn the Basics**, which will allow you to learn how to...
* understand basic elements of the Python language
* implement basic logical elements (such as for loops and if statements)
* think through basic problems to arrive at code based solutions

We also recommend the *Pandas Basics* exercise under the **Data Science Tutorials**, where you will learn....
* about DataFrames (a data structure that is similar to a table)
* how to import a csv as a DataFrame (and vice-versa)
* how to run specify elements in a DataFrame for manipulation

**Once you have completed this, you can come back to the Data Repository main page to learn about Jupyter Notebooks, and start running code! **

You will find examples relevant to immigration  that you can run, and modify to adapt to a different dataset!
