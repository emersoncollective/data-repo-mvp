    "# USCIS Credible Fear Spreadsheets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides functionality to extract data data from the [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/semi-monthly-credible-fear-and-reasonable-fear-receipts-and-decisions) spreadsheets on credible and reasonable fear interviews. This data is released by USCIS twice monthly and features different data tables embedded in a single excel spreadsheet worksheet. This data can be time consuming to work with given that the data is reported in two week increments vs monthly totals and it has rolling time period, meaning that each new file has fewer historical months of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../misc/images/uscis_webpage.png\" width=900 />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The USCIS only displays the most recent data on the their webpage, but other files are available by modifying the download url. \n",

    "```https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/reports/Congressional-Semi-Monthly-Report-11-01-20-to-11-15-21.xlsx```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use python to download all available files, then  extract example subsets of data across the history of these spreadsheets and summarize by month. \n",
