    "\n",
    "This notebook provides functionality to programatically aquire and then process census data. Such data can be obtained manually by visitng [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), but often the format of the data or even the act of downloading it can be time consuming. Therefore we are demonstrating how you can pull data from the census in an easily reproducible way and process it into the format needed for analysis. Note that different uses will require different formats so we will just demonstrate one such case, but hope that it provides the necessary experience for a user to alter the code for their use case.

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The US Census provides [APIs](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.htm) for programatically accessing census data. We could use those directly but it would require us to write a large amount of code. Therefore we will leverage an available Python library called [`censusdata`](https://github.com/jtleider/censusdata) to help us obtain the data. \n",
