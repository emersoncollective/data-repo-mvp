    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides functionality to programmatically acquire and then process Census data. Such data can be obtained manually by visiting [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), but often the format of the data or even the act of downloading it can be time consuming. Therefore we are demonstrating how you can pull data from the census in an easily reproducible way and process it into the format needed for analysis. Note that different uses will require different formats so we will just demonstrate one such case, but hope that it provides the enough exposure for you to feel comfortable altering the code to fit your use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The US Census provides [APIs](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) for programmatically accessing Census data. We could use those directly but it would require us to write a large amount of code. Therefore we will leverage an available Python library called `censusdata` [link](https://github.com/jtleider/censusdata) to help us obtain the data and then we will use some code to process it. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Census API KEY** \n",
    "\n",
    "To download large amounts of data or use the Census API frequently, you must obtain a Census API key. To request a Census API key, go [here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) and enter your information and enter your information, you will then be sent a key over email.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep your key private**, no one else should use your API key as it's linked to your email address and is used to monitor your usage of the Census API.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API key is just a random string of numbers and letters. It will look something like this `96e87430410c12340dc57c6e556edf5c25905d70`. Below (where relevant) we will highlight where you can add your key when downloading data.\n"
